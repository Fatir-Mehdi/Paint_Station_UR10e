## **Introduction**

This project simulates a robotic paint station using the UR10e industrial manipulator in RoboDK. The simulation is designed to mimic a real-world spray-painting operation with high accuracy and includes Python scripting for realistic paint application.

---

## **Project Overview**

- **Objective**: Simulate spray-painting of an object using an industrial robot.
- **Platform**: RoboDK for simulation and Python for scripting.
- **Robot**: UR10e industrial serial manipulator.
- **Key Components**:
  - Reference frames for workspace alignment.
  - Tool calibration and selection.
  - Surface target programming.
  - Python-based macros for paint simulation.

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**
- **RoboDK**: Download and install from [robodk.com](https://robodk.com).
- **Python 3.x**: Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org).

### **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/RoboDK-Paint-Station.git
cd RoboDK-Paint-Station
```

### **Import RoboDK Files**
1. Open `paint_station.rdk` in RoboDK.
2. Verify the robot, tool, and object configurations.
3. Run the main program to simulate the painting process.

---

## **Simulation Workflow**

1. **Robot Selection**
   - Add the UR10e manipulator to the RoboDK workspace.
   - Configure its base frame to align with the workspace.

2. **Adding Reference Frames**
   - Create frames to ensure proper alignment of the robot, tool, and object.

3. **Object Selection**
   - Load the workpiece in `.stl` format and place it at the desired position.

4. **Tool Selection and TCP Setting**
   - Import the paint gun tool in `.tool` format.
   - Calibrate the Tool Center Point (TCP) to align it with the robot arm.

5. **Teaching Targets**
   - Define key surface points for painting.
   - Use RoboDK's teaching feature to program the robot's movement.

6. **Python Macro Integration**
   - Write the `SprayOn` Python macro for paint simulation.
   - Call the macro within the main program for realistic effects.

7. **Program Execution**
   - Combine all individual programs into a single main program.
   - Export the final program as a script for deployment.

## **Key Features**

- **Robot Configuration**:
  - UR10e manipulator with realistic motion paths.

- **Tool Integration**:
  - Paint gun with accurate scaling and calibration.

- **Realistic Simulation**:
  - Python scripting for enhanced realism in spray-painting.

- **Exported Scripts**:
  - Generate deployable code for robotic systems.

# **Simulation Process Details**

This file explains the detailed step-by-step process for creating the paint station simulation in RoboDK.

---

## **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **1. Workspace Setup**
1. Add the UR10e robot from the RoboDK library.
2. Define reference frames for the robot base, tool, and object.
3. Import the workpiece model (`ObjectModel.stl`) into the workspace.

### **2. Tool Integration**
1. Import the paint gun model in `.tool` format.
2. Calibrate the TCP to align with the robot flange.
3. Test the tool's movement using RoboDK's tool visualization feature.

### **3. Teaching Targets**
1. Use RoboDK's "Teach Target" option to define surface points on the object.
2. Create a program to move between these targets smoothly.

### **4. Python Macro Integration**
1. Write the `SprayOn` macro in Python to simulate paint spraying.
2. Test the macro by running it on a simple motion program.

### **5. Combining Programs**
1. Integrate all individual programs into a main program.
2. Add the macro call within the main program.

### **6. Simulation Execution**
1. Run the main program in RoboDK to visualize the painting process.
2. Export the final program as a script for real-world deployment.
